//! One running agent process attached to a pseudo-terminal.
//!
//! A [`PtySession`] owns:
//!
//! * a per-session [`tempfile::TempDir`] (the agent's working directory),
//! * the master end of a PTY pair (`portable-pty`),
//! * a writer into the PTY's stdin,
//! * a [`portable_pty::ChildKiller`] handle for the spawned process,
//! * a background blocking task that reads the PTY's output and fans it out
//!   through `broadcast::Sender<OutputChunk>`,
//! * a watcher task (which owns the actual `Child`) that broadcasts the
//!   process exit status through `broadcast::Sender<ExitStatus>`.
//!
//! The temp dir is dropped when the session value is dropped, so any cleanup
//! path — explicit [`PtySession::terminate`] or natural process exit followed
//! by the manager removing the entry — also removes the working directory.
//!
//! ## Concurrency
//!
//! The exit-watcher task owns the [`portable_pty::Child`] exclusively so it
//! can block in `wait()` without holding any lock the session might need.
//! [`PtySession::terminate`] kills the child through a separately-cloned
//! [`portable_pty::ChildKiller`], avoiding the obvious deadlock of a kill
//! call waiting on a mutex the wait-loop already holds.
